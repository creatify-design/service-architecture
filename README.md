# Creatify Service Architecture and Technology Stack
This document contains a description Creatify's service architecture and technology stack. Creatify has bold ambitions, and the technology requirements are equally as ambitious. We first present a service-orientated description of Creatify's technical system. We then focus on individual supporting services in detail and discuss implementations.

# Creatify Service Architecture
A first attempt at a high-level visual representation of Creatify's service architecture is shown below. Each component is referred to as a *manager* with particular responsibilities. The tasks needed to be completed to meet a manager's responsibilities can be performed by and individual, group of individuals, automated system, or combintation.
